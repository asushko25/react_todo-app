# React Todo App with API

### A brief description of the project:
This project is a complete React Todo App that connects to an external API to manage and store todos. Users can add, delete, update, and mark todos as completed. The app provides a smooth user experience, ensuring data persistence through API integration. It demonstrates practical usage of React components, hooks, and asynchronous API requests using modern JavaScript (ES6+).
